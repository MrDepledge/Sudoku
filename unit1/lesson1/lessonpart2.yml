title: Updating code so that you can't change the original puzzle
content: >
  We need to change the code in **SolvePuzzle** so that


  * after the user has entered their triple (row, column, value)

  * and it is checked to be OK

  * We check across the values in the **Puzzle** list

  * if we find a similar row and column then we don't allow the user to make
  this move and put up an error message 


  **For example:** 


  The **Puzzle** list contains the value `314`\

  If the user enters the triple `318` they are trying to change the value of a
  cell in the original puzzle.


  In **ShowPuzzle**


  * You could make use of **CellInfo** this would be storing `'318'` and you
  need to scan the **Puzzle** list and also match against `'314'` (ie you are
  matching the first two characters only

  * You could make use of **Row** ( int 3 ) and **Column** ( int 1 ) and do
  something similar to the above


  Develop a solution for **ShowPuzzle** and then copy this subroutine and send a
  copy to Mr Colliver.


  **NOTE** - you can make use of the `simpler.py` file which contains a very cut
  down version of the code that does run and allow you to solve this problem.
